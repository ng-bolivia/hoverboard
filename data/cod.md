**NG Bolivia** is the annual conference where people all over the country come to share ideas, experiences, new practices and, of course, the firm conviction to strengthen the community, and that the new connections made through the time spend in the conference are long lasting for this year and years to come.

To achieve this goal, the organization works hard to enforce the community and invite new people to join, with the only purpose of share the passion for the technology in which we are involved. That's why we are convinced, that to make this community one of the best, we have to take into account diverse groups of people without caring about their **gender**, **identity**, **sexual orientation**, **disability**, **physical appearance**, **corporal size**, **race**, **political affiliation or religion**.

But, we are also convice that to achieve this goal, it's important to have the compromise not only of the staff team, but the speakers and, of course, all the conference assistants.

That's why we established some rules of conduct. These will mark the guidelines to guarantee a friendly and unforgettable stay for everyone.
