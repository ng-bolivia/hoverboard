**NG Bolivia** is the annual conference where people all over the country come to share ideas, experiences, new practices and, of course, the firm conviction to strengthen the community, and that the new connections made through the time spend in the conference will be long lasting for this year and years to come.

To achieve this goal, the organization works hard to strengthen the community and invite new people to join, with the sole purpose of share the passion for the technology in which we are involved. That's why we are convinced, that to make this community one of the best, we have to include diverse groups of people without regard for their **gender**, **identity**, **sexual orientation**, **disability**, **physical appearance**, **body size**, **race**, **political affiliation or religion**.

But, we are also conviced that, to achieve this goal, it's important to have the commitment not only of the staff team, but also of the speakers and, of course, all the conference attendees.

That's why we established some rules of conduct. These will mark the guidelines to guarantee a friendly and unforgettable time for everyone.

## Rules of Conduct:

* Avoid talking in a tone that may be offensive or could make the people around you feel uncomfortable and/or insulted.

* Avoid making **jokes and/or comments** involving gender, identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, political affiliation or religion.

* Any new relationship made between assistants, speakers and the staff will be strictly related with the conference. This event doesn't have the purpose of looking for romance or relationships of another kind.

* *Bullying* is not allowed for any reason, including staff, speakers or assistants.

* Avoid polarized themes that could make other people feel uncomfortable, for example, talking about some specific political party or religion.

## Report violations to the Code of Conduct:

The team has designed the mechanism to help you to report any act that breaks the code of conduct.

If you witness any act that breaks the code of conduct, look for some staff member immediately. They will be properly identified.

The organization team keeps the right to take the proper actions if someone breaks the code of conduct. These actions can range from removing them from the conference without the right to any refund, to notifying the corresponding authorities in our territory, depending on the seriousness of the case.
